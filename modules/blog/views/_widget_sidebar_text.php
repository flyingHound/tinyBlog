	<h3>REAL voices. REAL stories.</h3>

	<p>Back in the day, you needed big media. Now? <b>You’ve got a blog. That’s power.</b></p>

	<p>People say it’s tough to stand out. I say - <b>not for winners like you.</b></p>

	<p>You're not waiting. You’re writing. You’re leading. <b>That's how champions do it.</b></p>

	<p>The world needs truth. It needs guts. And let me tell you - <b>you’ve got both.</b></p>

	<p>This post right here? People are talking about it! <b><a href="<?= BASE_URL.'blog/post/'.out($first_post->url_string) ?>" target="_self">'<?= htmlspecialchars_decode($first_post->title) ?>'</a></b> - it’s making waves!</p>
	
	<p><b>Big energy. Great content. Total success!</b></p>
